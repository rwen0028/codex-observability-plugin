# Langfuse Tracing Plugin for OpenAI Codex

A [Codex](https://developers.openai.com/codex) plugin that traces agent turns, model calls, tool executions, token usage, and subagent threads to [Langfuse](https://langfuse.com).

Once enabled, every Codex turn shows up in Langfuse as a trace you can inspect, debug, evaluate, and monitor for cost — turning Codex from a black box into an observable agent.

## What gets traced

After each Codex turn, the plugin reads the session's rollout transcript and uploads it to Langfuse as a [trace](https://langfuse.com/docs/observability/data-model). The structure mirrors how Codex actually works:

- **Turn** (`Codex Turn`, an [agent observation](https://langfuse.com/docs/observability/features/observation-types)) — one trace per turn, from your prompt to the final answer.
- **Generations** — one per model response within the turn, with the model name, reasoning, assistant text, the tool calls it requested, and token usage.
- **Tool calls** — `exec_command`, `apply_patch`, `spawn_agent`, MCP tools, web search, etc., each with its input, output, and error status. Failed commands are flagged as errors.
- **Subagents** — subagent threads are resolved from their own rollout files and nested under the spawning turn.
- **Sessions** — all turns from one Codex session are grouped via the Codex thread id, so you can replay the whole session in Langfuse's [Sessions](https://langfuse.com/docs/observability/features/sessions) view.

Interrupted turns (where you cancel mid-response) are still uploaded and flagged as interrupted.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 22
- Codex >= 0.128
- A [Langfuse Cloud](https://cloud.langfuse.com) account (or a [self-hosted](https://langfuse.com/self-hosting) instance) and API keys

## Installation

### 1. Add the plugin marketplace

```bash
codex plugin marketplace add langfuse/codex-observability-plugin
```

### 2. Enable the plugin

Enable plugin hooks and the tracing plugin globally in `~/.codex/config.toml`, or only for a specific project in `<project>/.codex/config.toml`:

```toml
[features]
plugin_hooks = true

[plugins."tracing@codex-observability-plugin"]
enabled = true
```

### 3. Set your Langfuse credentials

Tracing stays off until `TRACE_TO_LANGFUSE` is `true`, so you opt in explicitly.

**Option 1: Shell environment (recommended)**

Add to your `~/.zshrc`, `~/.bashrc`, or `~/.bash_profile`:

```bash
export TRACE_TO_LANGFUSE="true"
export LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY="pk-lf-..."
export LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY="sk-lf-..."
export LANGFUSE_BASE_URL="https://cloud.langfuse.com" # 🇪🇺 EU (default)
```

**Option 2: JSON config file**

Create `~/.codex/langfuse.json` (global) or `<project>/.codex/langfuse.json` (per-project):

```json
{
  "enabled": true,
  "public_key": "pk-lf-...",
  "secret_key": "sk-lf-...",
  "base_url": "https://cloud.langfuse.com"
}
```

Config is resolved as **defaults → `~/.codex/langfuse.json` → `<project>/.codex/langfuse.json` → environment variables** (environment wins). `LANGFUSE_CODEX_*` variables take precedence over the matching standard `LANGFUSE_*` variables, so you can scope credentials to Codex without disturbing other Langfuse tooling.

### 4. Get your Langfuse API keys

1. Go to [cloud.langfuse.com](https://cloud.langfuse.com) (or your self-hosted instance).
2. Create a project (or open an existing one).
3. Go to **Settings → API Keys → Create new API keys**.
4. Copy the **public** key (`pk-lf-...`) and **secret** key (`sk-lf-...`).

Run a Codex turn, then open your Langfuse project to see the trace.

## Troubleshooting

- **No traces appear** — confirm `plugin_hooks = true`, the plugin is enabled in `config.toml`, and `TRACE_TO_LANGFUSE=true` is visible to the Codex process. Run with `LANGFUSE_CODEX_DEBUG=true` to log to stderr.
- **Authentication fails** — check that the public/secret keys are valid and that `LANGFUSE_BASE_URL` matches the region the keys belong to.
- **Traces land in the wrong project** — API keys are project-scoped in Langfuse; use the keys for the project you want.
- **Testing hook failures** — set `LANGFUSE_CODEX_FAIL_ON_ERROR=true` together with `LANGFUSE_CODEX_DEBUG=true` to make Codex report upload or flush errors instead of failing open.
- **Checking dedup sidecars** — successful uploads of completed turns are recorded next to the rollout as `<rollout>.jsonl.langfuse`. If a Stop hook reads the rollout before Codex has written the turn-completed marker, the trace may upload without a sidecar entry; the next Stop hook will finalize and mark it.
- **Verifying in Langfuse** — use `npx langfuse-cli api traces list --from-timestamp <recent ISO> --limit 10 --order-by timestamp.desc --fields core,metrics,observations --json` with credentials for the same project.
- **Sandboxed/network-restricted runs** — Codex sandbox or network policy can prevent exports from reaching Langfuse. Debug logging and fail-on-error mode are the quickest way to distinguish hook execution from network failure.
- **Self-hosting** — the TypeScript SDK requires Langfuse platform version >= 3.95.0.

## Data sent to Langfuse

When enabled, the plugin uploads completed Codex transcript data to Langfuse: prompts, assistant messages, reasoning summaries, tool-call inputs and outputs, model metadata, and token usage. Do not enable tracing for sessions containing data you do not want stored in Langfuse. Use `LANGFUSE_CODEX_MAX_CHARS` to cap how much of large inputs/outputs is captured.

## How it works

Codex emits a [`Stop` hook](https://developers.openai.com/codex) after each turn, passing the path to the session's rollout transcript on stdin. The plugin:

1. Reads the rollout JSONL and reconstructs each turn (model steps, tool calls, usage, subagents).
2. Converts them into Langfuse observations with the original timestamps, using the [Langfuse TypeScript SDK](https://langfuse.com/docs/observability/sdk/overview) on top of OpenTelemetry.
3. Records uploaded turn ids in a sidecar file (`<rollout>.langfuse`) so resuming a session does not re-upload completed turns.

The hook fails open: any tracing error is logged and swallowed so it never blocks your Codex session.

## Development

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm test        # run the test suite
pnpm run lint    # prettier + tsc + verify the committed bundle is current
pnpm run build   # bundle the hook to plugins/tracing/dist/index.mjs
```

The hook ships as a single self-contained `plugins/tracing/dist/index.mjs` (no install step runs when Codex loads the plugin), so the bundle is committed to the repo. After changing anything under `src/`, run `pnpm run build` and commit the updated bundle — CI enforces this via `pnpm run lint`.
